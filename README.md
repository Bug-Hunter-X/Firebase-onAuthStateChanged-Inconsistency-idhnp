# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener's inconsistent triggering across various platforms and network conditions.

## Bug Description

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener, which is crucial for handling authentication state changes in Firebase applications, might fail to consistently update the application's state. This can result in issues where user authentication status isn't correctly reflected within the application, even after successful login or logout.

## Reproduction Steps

The `firebaseBug.js` file contains code that simulates various scenarios to illustrate the inconsistent behavior of `onAuthStateChanged`.  The lack of consistent triggering is especially noticeable in environments with unstable network connections.

## Solution

The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file demonstrates a solution to mitigate the inconsistency.  It involves using a combination of techniques like persistent storage of authentication state and robust error handling to ensure that the application's state accurately reflects the user's authentication status, even in unreliable network conditions.
